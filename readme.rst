DistMQTT
======

``DistMQTT`` is an open source `MQTT`_ client and broker implementation. It
is a fork of `hbmqtt`_ with support for `anyio`_ and `DistKV`_.

DistMQTT provides a straightforward API based on coroutines, making it easy
to write highly concurrent applications.

DistMQTT? DistKV? DistWhatever?
-------------------------------

DistMQTT is a stand-alone MQTT client and server.

`DistKV <https://github.com/M-o-a-T/distkv>`_ is a distributed key-value
storage system. It uses the DistMQTT client library as its connector to
some MQTT server, preferably Mosquitto or some other low-latency broker.

A DistMQTT server can hook into DistKV so that some messages are persisted,
translated (store `True` and `False` instead of "on" and "off"), filtered
(e.g. the client can only modify existing messages but not add any), et
al..
