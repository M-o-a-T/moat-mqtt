MoaT-MQTT
======

``MoaT-MQTT`` is an open source `MQTT`_ client and broker implementation. It
is a fork of `hbmqtt`_ with support for `anyio`_ and `DistKV`_.

MoaT-MQTT provides a straightforward API based on coroutines, making it easy
to write highly concurrent applications.

Moat-MQTT? DistMQTT? MoaT-KV? Whatever?
--------------------------------------

MoaT-MQTT is a Python package that includes a stand-alone MQTT server, as
well as basic client scripts. It is based on hbmqtt and was previously
named "DistMQTT".

`MoaT-KV <https://github.com/M-o-a-T/moat-kv>`_ is a distributed key-value
storage system. It uses the MoaT-MQTT client library as its connector to
an MQTT server, preferably Mosquitto or some other low-latency broker.
It was previously named "DistKV".

A MoaT-MQTT server can hook into MoaT-KV so that some messages are persisted,
translated (i.e. store msgpack messages encoding `True` and `False`, instead of
the strings "on" and "off" (or "ON" and "OFF" or "1" and "0" or â€¦)), filtered
(e.g. the client can only modify existing messages but not add any), et al..
